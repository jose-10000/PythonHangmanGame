# Here we will create a simple hangman game using tkinter for the GUI. 
# This will be a simple version of the game where the player has to guess a word by entering letters. The player will have a limited number of attempts to guess the word, and the game will display the current state of the word and the number of attempts remaining. The player will be able to enter letters using a text entry box and a submit button. The game will end when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.

import tkinter as tk

class HangmanGame:
  def __init__(self, master):
    self.master = master
    self.master.title("Hangman Game")
    self.master.geometry("900x600")
    # Further GUI setup and game logic will be added here
    
def main():
  root = tk.Tk()
  app = HangmanGame(root)
  root.mainloop()
  
if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
