# Implementing the game logic
We'll implement the game logic in Python. Here's the plan:

1. Create a function to choose a random word from a list of words.
2. Create a function to check if a letter is in the word.
3. Create a function to update the word with the correct guesses.
4. Create a function to check if the game is won or lost.
5. Create a function to play the game.
6. Test the game.
7. Refactor the code.
8. Test the game again.
9. Document the code.
10. Publish the code.
11. Celebrate!
12. Share the code with others.
13. Get feedback.
14. Improve the code.
15. Repeat steps 10-14 until satisfied.
16. Publish the final version.
17. Celebrate again!
